We have created a tile solver for simple puzzles like those here: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/puzzles/

Our project runs as a Java Applet. To run the project, download the files in a program like Eclipse and hit run. You may also run the executable Tiler.jar file which is ready-to-run.

As our program solves the puzzle, we also print output so you may check its progress.
